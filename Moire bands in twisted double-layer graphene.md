# Moiré bands in twisted double-layer graphene

双层石墨烯出现转角时，在整体层面会出现摩尔纹。

## Abstract
>A moiré pattern is formed when two copies of a periodic pattern are overlaid with a relative twist. 
We address the electronic structure of a twisted two-layer graphene system, showing that in its continuum Dirac model the moiré pattern periodicity leads to moiré Bloch bands.
The two layers become more strongly coupled and the Dirac velocity crosses zero several times as the twist angle is reduced.
For a discrete set of magic angles the velocity vanishes, the lowest moiré band flattens, and the Dirac-point density-of states and the counterflow conductivity are strongly enhanced.

当一个周期性图案的两个副本以相对扭曲的方式叠加在一起时，就会形成摩尔纹图案。
我们讨论了扭曲的两层石墨烯系统的电子结构，表明在其连续的狄拉克模型中，摩尔纹的周期性导致了摩尔布洛赫带。
两层石墨烯变得更加强烈的耦合，并且随着扭曲角度的减小，狄拉克速度多次过零。
对于一组离散的魔角，速度消失，最低的摩尔带变平，迪拉克点状态密度和逆流电导率强烈增强。

systems are known (1–8) to be strongly dependent on stacking
arrangement. 
In bulk graphite 0° and 60° relative orientations of the individual layer honeycomb lattices yield rhombohedral and Bernal crystals, but other twist angles also appear in many samples (9). Small twist angles are particularly abundant in epitaxial graphene layers grown on SiC (10, 11), but exfoliated bilayers can also appear with a twist, and arbitrary alignments between adjacent layers can be obtained by folding a single graphene layer(12, 13)
